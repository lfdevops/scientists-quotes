# Scientists' Quotes Generator

## Overview
The Scientists' Quotes Generator is a web application designed to display random quotes from famous scientists. The project demonstrates the use of JavaScript ES6 modules for code organization and is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features
- Randomly displays an inspirational quote from a renowned scientist.
- Clean and user-friendly interface with a focus on minimalistic design.
- Responsive layout for a consistent experience across various devices.

## Modularization and Local Server Requirement
This project is structured using JavaScript ES6 modules, which involve separating the JavaScript code into different files (`main.js` and `quotes.js`). Due to browser security restrictions on loading ES6 modules from local file systems, it's necessary to use a local server for testing the project in a browser. This approach mimics a real-world web hosting environment and ensures the modules are loaded correctly.

## Running the Project
To run this project locally, you'll need to set up a local server. Here is a common method:

### Using Node.js and `http-server`
1. Ensure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is installed on your system.
2. Install `http-server` globally using npm: `npm install -g http-server`.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
4. Run the command `http-server`.
5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`.
6. As an alternative, use the extension Live Server in VSCode.
